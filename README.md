## About

The main objective of Arx Chess is to capture all of the opponent's castles. To achieve this, you must gain control of the board and acquire new pieces. These include not only regular pieces but also compound ones. You unlock the compound pieces by purchasing the basic ones first. You need to manage your gold wisely between expanding your forces and upgrading your castles. Have fun!
